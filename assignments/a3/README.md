# Feature Engineering with Logistic Regression. 

To begin, you'll need to create code that loads in the data(the file data.csv is found in the one-drive assignments folder under a3 directory) and builds a Logistic regression model to classify the breast cancer tumor type ; Malignant(M) as +ve class and Benign as -ve class and output the predictions in a CSV format.

To get a full grade on this assignment, you'll need to:

Explore different features for your regression model. And compare the model performance using different features.
Create plots to show model performance and perform error analysis to understand how your model is performing.
The process you explore will be reflected in your write-up, but your code must reproduce your output for us to recreate your results.

### About the data                                                         

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Please submit your answers on Canvas before the deadline (Sep 20th 5:59p CT)

## Submitting your work:
Once you are done create a compressed file called yourUTEID_a3.zip. Upload/Submit this file on the canvas before the due date.

Upload your materials and all your code and data.

Your upload must include be as following:

Code: Python (.py) files or IPython notebook
Output: CSV (.csv)
Write-up: PDF (.pdf)
Your PDF write-up should have:

A discussion of what you tried
Plots to show your error analysis
A discussion of what directions worked (and which didn't) You are limited to 500 words (but unlimited figures)
