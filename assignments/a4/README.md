Text classification algorithms are at the heart of a variety of software systems that process text data at scale. In this assignment we will be working on building and evaluating a Supervised Text Classification Model.

Here’s what to concentrate on while you deliver any of you assignments:

Explain your approach/methods, conclusions, and any/all assumptions
Clearly document and structure your code
Describe any ideas you attempted that didn't work
Describe interesting ideas you didn't have time to complete; but would have tried if you were to have more time on your end.
Please answer all questions and submit your answers on Canvas before the deadline (Sep 27th 5:59p CT)

## Submitting your work:
Once you are done create a compressed file called yourUTEID_a4.zip. Upload/Submit this file on the canvas before the due date.

 

### Question 1 (4 points)

Read the text​txt ​file.
Using the text file, calculate; (1) average word length (2) average sentence length and (3) the number of times the word “king” appears
Calculate the TF-IDF scores of all the words in the text file (feel free to remove stop words for this). Submit the “term, tf-idf score” as an output file.
Display the top 100 TF-IDF terms in a Word cloud.

### Question 2 (6 points)

Your work will be evaluated on the following aspects of your work:

Step 1: Gather/Load Data (Using sklearn.datasets is acceptable)
Step2: Define your problem (Choose any 1 category as positive class and define a binary classification problem. For example GCAT or MCAT or ECAT as positive class)
Step 3: Prepare Your Data (Select, Preprocess, transform to features, choose your features and explain)
Step 4: Choose a Model for classification ( SVM, Logistic Regression or other)
Step 5: Build, Train, and Evaluate Your Model
Datasets - Run your model on the Datasets below. Explain your work and findings clearly.

RCV1 Test CollectionLinks to an external site.
Note: There are two versions of the test collection. RCV1-v2 distribution is available on the web. For this assignment, just using the datasets in scikit-learn library’s dataset is sufficient.
