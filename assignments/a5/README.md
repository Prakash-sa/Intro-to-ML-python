## Question 1: (5 points)
Problem statement
You work for a startup, and your CEO/founder thinks the next big thing is peer-to-peer car sharing.  She believes that with cars spending 90% of their life in a garage or parked on the street people will be interested in renting them to make some extra cash.  She wants you to investigate the idea and develop a proposal for a peer-to-peer car sharing application.  The proposal should include a recommendation for the design of the application, potential applications of AI, the value proposition, and the business model.

Deliverables for Question 1
The goal of this problem is to better understand how you would approach data science/AI problems with as near to real-life situations as possible. As a deliverable, prepare 1 page document on the topic below. I recognize that you’re working with incomplete information, so I am looking for how you approach breaking down and solving for problems.

Prepare a 1 page write up describing your approach to developing your proposal to the CEO. The write up is not the proposal itself. It should include answers to below questions:

What questions would you have, who would you want to ask, and how would you go about trying to find an answer?
What do you need to learn and how would you approach learning what you need?
What assumptions are you making?
How would you measure success?
What risks are there in your plan and how would you manage that risk?

## Question 2 (5 points)
Task 1: Build a Logistic Regression Model (using Scikit-learn) to classify the Universities into two class (Private and Public).

Task 2: Build a K-means Clustering Algorithm (using Scikit-learn) to cluster the Universities into two groups (Private and Public).

Note: While building the clustering model, drop the “private” column. Use the “private” column value only for evaluation purposes.

For both Task 1 and Task 2

Read the Dataset into a data frame.
Explain any preprocessing steps and exploratory Data analysis that was performed before you start building your model.
Build the model and get the class/cluster assignments.
Evaluate the performance of both the models using the “Private” field value as Label from the dataset. Show the confusion matrix and compute the F1 score for both the models.
Which of the two models (Logistic regression or K-means) you think worked better and why?

Submitting your work:
Once you are done create a compressed file called yourUTEID_a5.zip. Upload/Submit this file on the canvas before the due date.
