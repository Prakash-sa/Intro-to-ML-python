For the first year they are fostered by families who expose them to as many things as possible and even then after a year the majority of them are deemed not fit for service work. They have to be ultra confident and never startled never afraid of anything etc... She seem like a good pet but the very opposite of what a service dog should be."

"Brian Barczyk", 36364,"Ive been surrounded by pets my entire life. My parents both had pets as children. My dad has kept fish since he was a child - my grandad even kept fish that have since become illegal to import into the UK and they both had dogs growing up [my grandad had a gorgeous Pyrenees x St Bernard]. Weve had 8 cats 3 dogs 6 rats 5 guinea pigs chinese water dragon crested gecko poison dart frogs stick insects crabs and too many fish currently 5 cats 3 dogs and the fish [though I plan to get a ball python soon]. When I move out I want to limit myself more than my parents have. I would love to have a ball python a dog or two some fish and maybe a mexican black kingsnake and rats again [which compared to the pets we have now doesnt sound like a lot]. Ive found that Ill make any excuse to look at animals be it ducks at the lake pets in a pet store zoos which does frustrate my friends and bore my family but its one of the few things that Im passionate about and as long as owners can provide care for their animals it shouldnt matter whether someone else thinks they have too many."

"New York Bully Crew", 64972,"I love how the bully crew calls the dogs bully babies instead of pitbulls. Pitbull is a term for the scumbags that use dogs to fight. I prefer to use names that were intended for the beautiful dogs they are...amstaffs...american bulldogs...bull terriers. And hell bully babies in general for all those that are mixed or pure because ya all know as well as I do love is love. I hate the name pitbull because it was the name given by dog fighters. Ive found people respond better with the original names of the dogs. Its the stigma that the term pitbull brings that I think destroys these dogs true personalities."

"Cole & Marmalade", 104598,"I love ur videos n i know that u are a person who is doing alot to help animals but still u dont have the right to interfere with nature. like all natural process reproduction is also essential and evolving for them just because we love specific kind of animals and started giving them shelter that is the only way for their sustainance before our interference cats and dogs were living on their own in nature. Whats wrong is government and society to think that a particular land belongs to them n if animals want to live on that space they have to live according to our rules. You can never even think about a rule to stop a poor or weak human from reproduction bt this is so ok to spay n neuter animals"

"Rogan Shannon", 112133,"It seems to me that the history of writing is often romanticized.  The four places in history that developed writing systems were due to having actual needs - agriculture for growing communities required more brain power than individuals could muster.  They needed to offload their past learning into written documents.  This way new people can learn what to do without bugging the few people already know effectively creating government ordinances.  Seeing the power of communicating across distances some people borrowed the governments writing system and tailored it for their own purposes.  The most effective motivator for learning to read and write has always been a government requiring someone to understand a writing system under punishment of losing money.I believe writing to be useful as an alternate rendering of ideas.  Yes ASL videos capture your meaning accurately for someone who knows ASL.  It has a lot of nuance that culturally literate people may notice.  But the closed captions are there to eliminate the nuances.  You use standard spelling and proper grammar so others can look up your meaning even if they are not culturally literate English speakers.If you had published your captions in a blog post people can actually read four times faster than your speech / signing.  I could skim the paragraphs of the blog post quickly looking for something that is relevant to me.  It can be indexed by Google or I can just use the Find feature in my browser for particular words.  It can be automatically (though poorly) translated into hundreds of other languages.  I can print it out and highlight parts of it for review later.  Dictionary writers encyclopedias magazines books newspapers etc. can use your blog post as source material.ASLWrite or Si5s could realize these kind benefits.  My personal take is that an alphabet is better than picture writing because it doubles as an index.  I created the ASLSJ writing system because I wanted to use ASL words in my computer programs.  It only uses the alphabets letters so I could upload the closed captions for your video in ASLSJ today.Your video starts with the ASL word hello.  In English each letter of a word phonetically tells you how to move your lips tongue and throat to pronounce the word.  In ASLSJ the word bepo-r phonetically tells you to put your open-B handshape (the first two letters - be) in front of your chin (the next letter - p) with the palm turned out (next letter - o) then move the hand to the right (-r).  bepo-r is an ASL idea.  It does not require translation into English and it does not require an artists painting like ASLWrite or Si5s.  Now I can create a dictionary to hold that word and thousands more.  Unfortunately it wouldnt help because nobody would want to read it - so were back to square one."
